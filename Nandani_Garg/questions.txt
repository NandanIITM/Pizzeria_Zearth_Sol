***********Exercise 1*******************
After a long deferment, the mayor of Z-city has allowed pizzerias to be opened in town. Pizzerias
used to be unlawful because of health reasons (according to the mayor). The city is big, and
suddenly there are pizzerias everywhere.
We can imagine the city like a matrix with NxN squares, where every square represents one block
of the city. Every pizzeria only delivers pizza to the nearby blocks. Specifically, every pizzeria
delivers pizza to every block that is at most Kblocks away from block the pizzeria's location.
Distance is determined by the minimum number of blocks that the delivery guy must take if he is
going East/West or North/South (moving diagonally is forbidden in Z-city). For example, let's say
that N=5 and a pizzeria is located at the block (3, 3). It can deliver to a 2 block distance at most.

The following map shows where the given pizzeria delivers pizzas.
00X00
0XXX0
XXXXX
0XXX0
00X00


Mr. Little Z loves pizza, so he wants to move to the block where he can have the greatest
selection of pizzas (the block that has the maximum number of pizzerias delivering to it).
Help Mr. Little Z building an API to find that maximum. In other words, if he moves to the block
with the greatest selection of pizzas, how many pizzerias will be able to deliver to his block?
INPUT: The first line of the standard input contains the two numbers N and M, and both numbers
are on the interval [1, 1000]. The number N represents the dimension of the city in blocks (the city
has NxN blocks). M is the number of pizzerias in the city. The following M lines contain
information about each pizzeria, given by the three numbers X, Y, K. The numbers X and Y
represent the block where the pizzeria is located, (1 <= X, Y <= N) and the number K represents
the maximum distance that the given pizzeria's delivery guy will travel to deliver pizza (1 <= K <=
1000).

OUTPUT: Write one number to the standard output that represents the number of pizzerias that
deliver pizzas to the block with the greatest selection of pizzas.


Input: 5 2 3 3 2 1 1 2
Output: 2

Explanation:
The first pizzeria delivers pizzas to the following
blocks:

00X00
0XXX0
XXXXX
0XXX0
00X00

and the second one:

00000
00000
X0000
XX000
XXX00

So the number of pizzerias that deliver pizzas to each block
is:

00100
01110
21111
12110
11200

So the maximum number is 2.


Please complete all the following
questions:
1. Write down your thoughts on how you would approach this problem briefly.
2. Code down the solution with a language of your choice.
3.What is the complexity of your approach? Can we do better?
4. Deploy the solution as a service into AWS or GCP and release the service endpoint.
5. Release test for each main method and for the application test (use one of the frameworks
used for the specific language - pytest, junit, scalatest, etc.




***********Exercise 2*******************
Mr. Little Z is on winter vacation, and he has decided to go to the planet Zearth. The only way of
traveling through space is by using the aliens' teleportation machines. Mr. Little Z can teleport
directly from planet Earth to the planet Zearth, but it is really risky. The aliens haven't perfected
their teleportation machine. The greater the distance of traveling the bigger the risk. Because of
this, the aliens have built more teleportation stations all throughout space. Teleporting through
consecutive teleportation stations lowers the risk.
Mr. Little Z wants to go to the planet Zearth using the path where the teleportations are as short
as possible - the path where the longest teleportation on it is minimized.
Mr. Little Z opened http://www.Space-net.spc and found a list of all the space teleportation
stations. He decided to use the least risky path, as described above.
Help Mr. Little Z building an API to find the safest path from Earth to the planet Zearth: the path
where the longest distance he has to teleport is minimized.

INPUT:
The first line of the standard input contains three real numbers, each from the interval [-
10000.00, 10000.00], representing the 3D coordinates of the planet Zearth. The next line
contains a number N, corresponding to the number of teleportation stations in space
(1<=N<=500). Each of the next N lines contains three real numbers each from the interval
[-10000.00, 10000.00], representing the 3D coordinates for each station.
Note: The 3D coordinates of Earth are (0.0, 0.0, 0.0). On the planets Earth and Zearth there are
teleportation stations, too.

OUTPUT: To the standard output write one real number to 2 decimal places, representing
the maximum distance of the safest path on Mr. Little Z's way to Zearth.


Input: 2.00 2.00 2.00 3 0.00 0.00 2.00 0.00 2.00 2.00 2.00 0.00 0.00
Output: 2.00


Additional example:
Input: 2.00 2.00 2.00 3 1.00 1.00 1.00 1.00 2.00 2.00 2.00 2.00 1.00
Output: 1.73
